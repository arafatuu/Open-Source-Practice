# Open-Source-Practice
Some instruction for " UU Online Judge " :

I use "Header.php" as first page of this project so to view the project on your machine, dont use like "localhost/yourdirector/index.php"
but you may use "localhost/yourdirectory/Header.php".

Source is here: "https://github.com/shawon100/RUET-OJ" 
 I am very very thankful to Shawon Bhai for this great work that help me a lot.
